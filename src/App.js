          We are a team of five multi-disciplinary engineering,
          Computer Science, and Information Systems students whose desire
          is to serve educators by providing tools and resources that enable
          them to reach their students in meaningful ways.
          We encourage you to fill out the Project Ideation Form if
          you have questions or project ideas!

          As an example, we are currently building a small learning device designed to help students understand binary numbers. The client had voiced the difficulty in teaching his students about binary numbers. Our team took his struggle and worked to develop a solution. We completed the brainstorming, early design phases, and are finished the final product; the client will be receiving his complete product soon!
